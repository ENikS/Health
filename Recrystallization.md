Recrystallization
1.	Setup 1000 ml beaker in heating mantle, add stirrer and secure it in place.
2.	Add 500 – 750 ml of anhydrous ethanol. Must be 200 proof otherwise impurities will dissolve as well.
3.	Fill 50 ml beaker with powder and add it to ethanol.
4.	Heat to 70+ C° while stirring.
5.	Once temperature reaches 70 C° stop stirring and let suspension to precipitate (~5 min). Keep temperature above 70C°.
6.	Filter remaining suspension and leave precipitate in the beaker.
7.	Allow filtrate to crystallize and filter out the precipitate. This is the clean product.
8.	Filtered ethanol add to 1000 ml beaker with remaining sediment and heat to 70 C° while stirring.
9.	Filter out and discard remaining solids.
10.	Repeat step 3 or 6 if done.
11.	Soak Molecular Sieve 3a, Magnesium sulfate or Potassium carbonate in remaining ethanol to absorb water.
12.	Distill ethanol and reuse.
