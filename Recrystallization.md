Recrystallization
1.	Setup 1000 ml beaker in heating mantle and stirrer and fix it in place.
2.	Add 500 – 750 ml of anhydrous ethanol. Must be 200 proof otherwise salt will be dissolved as well.
3.	Fill 50 ml beaker with powder and add it to ethanol.
4.	Heat to 70 C° while stirring.
5.	Filter ethanol suspension and leave precipitate in the beaker
6.	Allow filtrate to crystallize and filter out the precipitate. This is the clean product
7.	Filtered ethanol add to 1000 ml beaker with remaining sediment and heat to 70 C° while stirring
8.	Filter out and discard remaining solids
9.	Repeat step 3 or 6 if done.
