1.	Reaction
2.	Extraction with DCM
3.	Extraction by boiling - ?
4.	DCM Distillation
5.	Acid Distillation - ?
6.	Reaction (if solution changes color it should be discarded)
7.	Boiling water out
8.	Drying the salt by heating to 180C° until melts
9.	Let it cool and grind into powder
10.	Recrystallization


Recrystallization
1.	Setup 1000 ml beaker in heating mantle and secure it in place, add stirrer.
2.	Fill beaker with anhydrous ethanol to 1000 ml mark.
3.	Fill 100 ml beaker with powder and add it to the 1000 beaker.
4.	Heat the mix to 70+ C° while stirring.
5.	Once temperature reaches 70 C° stop stirring and let suspension to precipitate (~5 min). Keep temperature above 70C°.
6.	Filter suspension and leave precipitate in the beaker.
7.	Boil filtrate with Activated Charcoal at reflux for about 5 minutes.
8.	Filter out charcoal and allow filtrate to crystallize. This is the clean product.
9.	Add filtered out ethanol to 1000 ml beaker with remaining sediment and heat to 70 C° while stirring.
10.	Filter and discard remaining solids.
11.	Repeat step 3 or 6 if done.
12.	Soak Molecular Sieve 3a, Magnesium sulfate or Potassium carbonate in remaining ethanol to absorb water.
13.	Distill ethanol and reuse.

Sodium Salt reacted in water.
Potassium Salt reacted in ethanol. Dry ethanol with Potassium carbonate and Molecular Cieves. The water is supplied with potassium so it needs to be dryed somehow.
Heat to 180C°.
Recrystalized in anhydrous ethanol.

Check if KOH with ethanol form two phase solution.
