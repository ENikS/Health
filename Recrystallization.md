Recrystallization
1.	Setup 1000 ml beaker in heating mantle and secure it in place, add stirrer.
2.	Fill beaker with anhydrous ethanol to 500 – 750 ml mark.
3.	Fill 50 ml beaker with powder and add it to the 1000 beaker.
4.	Heat the mix to 70+ C° while stirring.
5.	Once temperature reaches 70 C° stop stirring and let suspension to precipitate (~5 min). Keep temperature above 70C°.
6.	Filter suspension and leave precipitate in the beaker.
7.	Boil filtrate with Activated Charcoal at reflux for about 5 minutes.
8.	Filter out charcoal and allow filtrate to crystallize. This is the clean product.
9.	Add filtered out ethanol to 1000 ml beaker with remaining sediment and heat to 70 C° while stirring.
10.	Filter and discard remaining solids.
11.	Repeat step 3 or 6 if done.
12.	Soak Molecular Sieve 3a, Magnesium sulfate or Potassium carbonate in remaining ethanol to absorb water.
13.	Distill ethanol and reuse.
